# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: 'this' in Javascript? Well that's an easy one. It's a sticky note.
  Also, it's a way to link functions to objects?

  Researched answer:This references the object executing the current function. If the function is a method inside and object, this
  refers specifically to the object. If the function is not part of an object, 'this' represents the global object
  (window in browsers, global in nome); ex.. constructor function.



2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer: React is an open source user interface that was created by facebook and is used
  to offer a streamlined user experience. We use it to keep up with the demand of user expectations.

  Researched answer: What I said above; plus...
  It's a javascript library used to build webpages, mobile webpages, and native mobile apps. It's a component based app
  (many small pieces created to develop a larger more capable whole). It's used to change web applications live, without
  having to reload the page or effect the quality of use for the user.




3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer: Render, and I believe it is the code responsible for refreshing changes prompted by the user.

  Researched answer: Rendering is considered to be the most importance procedure managed by developers(front-end).
  The render method, in React, is the only method required in the 'class' component and describes the view to be rendered
  on the browser.



4. What is JSX? What is one notable difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer: JSX allows javascript to talk with html so you can run REACT. A major difference between the two when developing
  is that JSX requires a fragment '<></>'

  Researched answer: What I said above; plus JSX stands for JavascriptXML and is a syntax extension that allows
  developers to write HTML directly in REACT. When using JSX, the developer must return a single parent element or the code
  won't comply. In HTML, a parent element is not necessary so you are free to code.


  5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: Yarn is the OG resource negotiator and I believe it modifies JSON? I would really have to freshen up with my notes
  on this one.

  Researched answer: Yarn is a Javascript library developers use to build user-interface. Yarn caches every package it downloads, allowing it to parallelize operations. Yarn is also more stable and
  secure than previous options.



6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: I remember Austin mentioning an anonymous function in one of the lessons but I don't recall it's exact purpose.
  It felt like a place holder to call in later.

  Researched answer: An anonymous function is without a name and is often inaccessible after creation. They can be used as
  an argument for another function or to immediately invoke execution of a function.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: is the ability to render different UI markup if a condition is true/false. In REACT, you can render
markup based on condition.

2. Props: props give us the ability to communicate by passing data and methods between components; specifically nested ones

3. JavaScript Events:

4. Object oriented programming: programming that relies on the concept of classes and objects. Using simple, reusable code, to
structure a software program.

5. Ruby: is a simple syntax, open-source, and object oriented programming language.
